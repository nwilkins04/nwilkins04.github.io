                My name is Nicole Wilkins. I currently hold a B.A. and M.A. from UCF in teaching.<br> 
                For the past 7 years I have been an ESE teacher, doing one of the most challenging jobs physically and mentally that I could think of.<br> 
                After making the difficult decision to change my carreer I decided to something that has been around me my entire life, technology!
                I have always been interested in the workings of computers, even took one apart.<br>
                I then completed the UCF Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp and strongly believe that my diverse background
                will give me skills that I can bring to the table different then others!
