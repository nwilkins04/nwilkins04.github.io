                My name is Nicole Wilkins. I currently hold a B.A. and M.A. from UCF in teaching.<br> 
                Growing up with a cousin on the Autism Spectrum Disorder scale, I knew that working with others like her is exactly what I wanted to do.
                So off to college I went! I studied hard after four years I graduated with my Bachelors. Then got into graduate school and earned a grant to pay for it. So off 
                to teaching and grad school I went! I worked hard during the day with very difficult students, and studied very hard at night. After two years I graduated 
                with my Masters. (First on in my family I might add). <br>
                For the past 6 years I have been an ESE teacher, doing one of the most challenging jobs physically and mentally that I could think of. What got me through 
                the aggressive nature of my students was seeing the long-term progress. Knowing that what I was teaching them were life skills that they would always have.
                While I always saw the progress that not only I was making, but that my students were making, my bosses did not. I was always told the things that I was not
                doing correctly, the things that my students <em> should be doing </em>, but were not. <br> 
                After having one of the worst years I could imagine, I decided that I desperately needed a career change. This however, is not as easy as you may think. What
                am I supposed to do? I've gone to school for so many years to do this one thing, I excell in this one thing, I volunteer in this one thing. Stuck? Confused?
                You bet! After lots of talking with family, friends, and research. <strong> finally figured it out! Technology! </strong> Thats where everything is headed. Thats what my
                students love, technology! So here I am ready to learn a new skill to help those that see and explore the world differently. Hopefully my diverse background
                will give me skills that I can bring to the table different then others!
